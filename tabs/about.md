#### I am passionate about free software, addicted to the freedom that motorcycles offer, dreamer; that does not give up easily and respects what others think.

#### My professional life has been developed in IT support, more than 7 years of experience in end user and corporate support have trained me as a detail person, who works very well with groups, in decision making and attitudes of someone capable of working under pressure. Honest, assertive, always concerned about doing better every day.

#### that's me ...

#### Now I am reinventing myself, I want to resume my dream ... to be a developer. ðŸ˜‰
